# osuAntiCheat
A project I made to detect various osu! cheats and cheating methods.

# Usage
Don't. This is a proof-of-concept not meant to be actually run. It works but it's basically useless.

# Disclaimer
I do not in any way codone of cheating, this project hopefully demonstrates that this is the case. All cheatdetecting code that exists in this program is from having years of experience on how these cheats operate and having friends help me get the correct resources. I feel like I need to make the fact clear that I absolutely despise those who cheat in osu! and I sincerely hope they get banned. This project was made public because it has come to my attention that osu! has taken action towards cracking down on cheaters.

# License
Licensed under MIT, as all my projects always are. Reffering back to this page, or me, if you plan to use any of the code or if you'd like to reference to it would be nice, though.
