# osuAntiCheat
A project I made to detect various osu! cheats and cheating methods.

# Usage
Don't. This is a proof-of-concept not meant to be actually run. It works but it's basically useless.

# License
Licensed under MIT, as all my projects always are. Reffering back to this page, or me, if you plan to use any of the code or if you'd like to reference to it would be nice, though.
